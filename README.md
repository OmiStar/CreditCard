# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression

This project is a machine learning implementation to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the **Logistic Regression** algorithm. It demonstrates how supervised learning can be applied in a real-world financial scenario where fraud prevention is critical.

## 📌 Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a serious issue in the financial industry. The aim of this project is to build a predictive model that can identify fraudulent transactions using a dataset of anonymized credit card transactions.

## 🧠 Model Used

- **Logistic Regression** – A simple yet powerful classification algorithm suitable for binary classification problems like fraud vs. legitimate transactions.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- The dataset contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.
- Total records: 284,807 transactions
- Features are anonymized due to confidentiality (V1 to V28)
- Highly imbalanced dataset (492 frauds vs 284,315 legitimate)
